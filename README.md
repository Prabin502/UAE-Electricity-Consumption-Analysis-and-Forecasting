Electricity Consumption by Sector and Region in the United Arab Emirates
# UAE Electricity Consumption Analysis and Forecasting

## Overview

This project analyzes and forecasts electricity consumption across different sectors and regions in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The goal is to provide predictive insights that help government agencies, utility companies, and businesses optimize energy management and sustainability efforts.

## Problem Statement

- **Objective:** Analyze historical electricity consumption data and build a predictive model to forecast future consumption.
- **Impact:** Supports data-driven decision-making for energy resource allocation and efficiency improvements.

## Dataset

- **Source:** The dataset includes electricity consumption data categorized by region and sector in the UAE.
- **Features:** Includes factors like year, region, sector, and consumption levels.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SHAP, Joblib
- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, SVR

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize consumption trends over time.
   - Analyze regional and sector-wise patterns.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation:**
   - Train multiple regression models.
   - Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
   - Evaluate models using MAE, MSE, and R-squared scores.
4. **Forecasting & Insights:**
   - Generate predictions for future electricity consumption.
   - Interpret model results using SHAP values.
